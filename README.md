# Software Portfolio
Hi. ðŸ‘‹ I'm Travis. I'm a long time technologist with a passion for developing useful, usable software. This is a tiny bit of my portfolio.

## Mobile Apps
The last 10+ years of my career have been focused almost exclusively on building mobile apps (there was a cool kiosk and a bit of AWS tosssed in there as well). Here are a few examples.

### VA: Health and Benefits

[VA: Health and Benefits](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/va-health-and-benefits/id1559609596?platform=iphone) is a 
convenient place for Veterans to perform their most common tasks with VA.

My role on the project â€“ as mobile engineering lead in the Office of the CTO â€“ consists of providing technical, 
mobile, and design guidance to the contractor team building the product. I also perform VA-wide coordination and 
help the team get stuff done across the organization.

### U.S. Army Career Navigator 

[Career Navigator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/u-s-army-career-navigator/id796509388?platform=iphone) is the U.S. Army's 
flagship career app. The purpose of Career Navigator is to allow folks interested in the Army to browse careers, educate 
them about what the Army has to offer, and to let them decide when the time is right to contact a recruiter.

I was involved in every phase of Career Navigator, from concept to delivery. My contributions included: writing almost 
every line of code for the iOS app, leading the mobile team, and product owner on the contractor side of the house.

### U.S. Army ASVAB Challenge

[ASVAB Challenge](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/u-s-army-asvab-challenge/id1496772113?platform=iphone) is designed to 
help young people taking the ASVAB â€“ and timed tests in general â€“ get comfortable with the format of the test, 
understand the kinds of questions that will be asked, and master taking a test under time pressure.
